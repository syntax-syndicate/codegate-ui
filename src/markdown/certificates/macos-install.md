### CLI method

After downloading the certificate, open a terminal and run the following command:

```shell
security add-trusted-cert \
-d \
-r trustRoot \
-p ssl \
-p basic \
-k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain \
~/Downloads/codegate.crt
```

### GUI method

1. Open the downloaded certificate file; Keychain Access will open.
2. Depending on your macOS version, you may see the Add Certificates dialog. If so, select the `login` keychain, and click Add.
3. In Keychain Access, select the `login` keychain from the Default Keychains list on the left.
4. Search for "CodeGate" (it may not appear until you search), then in the search results, double-click the "CodeGate CA" certificate.
5. Expand the Trust section and set the "Secure Sockets Layer" and "X.509 Basic Policy" options to "Always Trust".
